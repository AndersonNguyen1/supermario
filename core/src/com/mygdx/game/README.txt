Hi my name is Anderson Nguyen and this is my Mario game! I used LibGDX and read the API to create the mario game. LibGDX comes with a lot of useful functions
that helped me build the world, character, and music. I used the Tiled program to create the maps in my game and then loaded them in my game using LibGDX functions

In this game, mario can so far move, break bricks, collides with objects. There is also music that plays in the background.
